# Minecraft Gulag Mod

This is a Minecraft server-side mod that spawns players in a new world each time they die.
They can get back to their home world by defeating the Ender Dragon in the new world.

## Why?

This mod aims to mimic the feel of Minecraft's Hardcore difficulty without the risk of permanently losing the world.
Instead, the players get punished by having to defeat the ender dragon in a new world. This will improve their skill
level and speedrun abilities.

## The Name

The mod is named after the "gulag" from Call of Duty, where players get a second chance if they defeat an opponent in
duel.
In a similar fashion, this mod gives the player a second chance by letting them duel the Ender Dragon instead of
deleting the world.
The only difference is that they will simply respawn in their new world if they die there.

## How does it work?

When a player dies, the gulag will be created with a random seed.
The player's inventory will be deleted, and they will be spawned into the gulag.
In multiplayer, all players who die afterwards will be brought to the same gulag.

The gulag consists of the Overworld, the Nether, and the End.
In the gulag, the player must play through the game as usual with the ultimate goal of defeating the ender dragon.
If a player dies in the gulag, their items will drop, and they will respawn in the gulag.

Upon defeating the ender dragon, the end portal will appear which will transport the player back to the spawn point (the
server spawn point) of their original world.
The player will keep all items acquired in the gulag.
As soon as everyone has left the gulag, it will be deleted.
Now, if a player dies, a new gulag will be created with a new random seed.
