# Minecraft Gulag Mod

This is a Minecraft server-side mod that spawns players in a new world each time they die.
They can get back to their home world by defeating the Ender Dragon in the new world.

## Why?

This mod aims to mimic the feel of Minecraft's Hardcore difficulty without the risk of permenently losing the world.
Instead, the players get punished by having to defeat the Ender Dragon in a new world. This will improve their skill level and speedrun abilities.

## The Name

The mod is named after the "gulag" from Call of Dutie, where players get a second chance if they defeat an opponent in duel.
In a similar fashion, this mod gives the player a second chance by letting them duel the Ender Dragon instead of deleting the world.
The only difference is that they will simply respawn in their new world if they die there.
